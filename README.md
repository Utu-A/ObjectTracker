<H1> Object Tracker OpenCV</H1>
A basic tracking snippet based on OpenCV that tracks an object.
First an initial image is taken and we need to select what we wish to track by drawing a box around it.
Then the snippet tracks the object as it moves through by using the camera and displaying it on the screen.
